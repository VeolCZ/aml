#TODO
- top-k accuracy (top-1, top-5, top-10) -> probably done
- k-fold -> absolutely not working
- The inference speed (timing how long the model takes to predict)? -> done
- ROC & AUROC (plots) -> sklearn, probably no
- loss plot -> fixxxed
- early stopping -> not really for trees as it doesn't make too much sense
- research about the space, if makes sense, implement it -> does it?

FOR FRIDAY:
ViT mumbo jumbo
