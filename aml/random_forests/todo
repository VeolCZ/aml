#TODO
- top-k accuracy (top-1, top-5, top-10) -> for sure not working
- k-fold -> absolutely working
- The inference speed (timing how long the model takes to predict)? -> done
- ROC & AUROC (plots) -> sklearn, probably no
- loss plot -> fixxxed
- early stopping -> not really for trees as it doesn't make too much sense # DONE
- research about the space, if makes sense, implement it -> does it?

FOR FRIDAY:
ViT mumbo jumbo
time for ViT
update requirements and docker
IOU & accuracy for ViT
tok_k accuracy for ViT
plotting curves for ViT
research what to put on tensorboard
clean up the mess in the docstrings, typehints and print statements

ALL OUTPUTS ON CPU WHEN IT COMES TO TENSORS

No duplicate code line pls.

Constants are in UPPER_CASE and should be centralized so that every function does not have magic number in it
for more info check how SEED is done
